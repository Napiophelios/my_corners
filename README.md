# my_corners
light weight alternative to my_corners mod by Don Bateman

This mod attempts to replicate nodes created in Don Bateman's my_corners mod
using the default 16 pixel textures in Minetest game and lots of texture modifiers.

This is based on the initial release of my_corners mod and does not include the code 
for in-game crafting machines.

Its intended for use with default 16 pixel textures from Minetest 0.4.12 game;
If you use alternate textures or textures with higher pixel count results may look awkward.
